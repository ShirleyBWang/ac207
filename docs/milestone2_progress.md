# Milestone 2B

  

This file contains a record of tasks assigned to each group member and the progress they have made on each task so far.

  

  

# Tasks assigned

We have divided different classes to be coded to each group member. The documentation associated with each class is also the responsibility of the group members assigned the task

- Dual number class (including all dunder methods and elementary operations as specified in the project requirements): Sarah and Shirley

- Forward mode (initializes the dual number and evaluates the function provided) (Alaric and Mahnum)

- Testing suite (Haoxue)

- Documentation (team effort)

  

# Progress so far

-- Dual number class (Sarah and Shirley):

- initial documentatation and functions have mostly been coded

- trignometric functions still need to be completed

--  Forward mode (Alaric and Mahnum):

- the basic structure of the code is complete

- adding more flexibility to the inputs and coherent documentation still to be completed

-- Testing suite (Haoxue):

- implementation of the 5 tests for different classes outlined in milestone 1 has been initiatated. This includes tests for dual class (add, multiplication etc)

- some tests still to be coded but the structure and type of test has already been delineated.


  

  

# Miscellaneous

We are having weekly meetings to discuss progress and run through any coding or implementation challenges. We have also decided on common format and documentation style.
